# Nested Ground Motion Set
The nested ground motion set is designed for the IDA to select a suite of records whose key intensity measures closely form an orthogonal grid.  This orthogonal grid (target) can be in high dimensions where multiple intensity measures are considered.  For instance, if using the spectral shape measure SaRatio ([Baker and Cornell, 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eqe.571); [Eads et al., 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eqe.2575)) and ground motion duration Ds<sub>5-75</sub> ([Bommer and Martinez-Pereira, 1999](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13632469909350343), the figure below shows one example grid target as well as the selected ground motion records.
