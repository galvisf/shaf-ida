# Site-Specific Adjustment Framework for Incremental Dynamic Analysis (SHAF-IDA)
Site-specific Hazard Adjustment Framework for Incremental Dynamic Analysis (SHAF-IDA) is developed for efficiently estimate site-specific structural performance assessment.  
IDA to efficiently estimate site-specific performance metrics including (1) engineering demand parameters (EDP), (2) damage measures (DM), and (3) collapse.
