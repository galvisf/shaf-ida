# Site-Specific Adjustment Framework for Incremental Dynamic Analysis (SHAF-IDA)
Site-specific Hazard Adjustment Framework for Incremental Dynamic Analysis (SHAF-IDA) is developed for efficiently estimate site-specific structural performance, e.g., esitmating probabilistic distributions of engineering demand parameters (EDP), evalutating fragilities of damage measures (DM), and assessing collapse risks.
Multiple stripe analysis (MSA) ([Jalayer, 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PhDT........34J/abstract)) is one state-of-the-art method to conduct this kind of site-specific seismic performance assessments and is recommended by FEMA P-58 (FEMA, 2012).
